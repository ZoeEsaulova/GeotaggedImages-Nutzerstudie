56cf14a23b61d3570d15a1e0,Saeedeh,Difficult:It challenges two different abilities: memories of the city, and spatial recognition. If the task is only about the second ability, it might be helpful to put some landmarks/name of the streets on the photos. If testing the first ability is also important, it should have been somehow separated from the second one. ,Like: I tried to use the angles between the streets to find the right camera angle, sometimes without knowing the place, or not being sure about the place. ,Dislike: ,Difficult: ,Like: ,Dislike:

56d09ac49352a7914a102f40,,Difficult:I was using the blue camera "beam" as a guide to find the locations/houses at the edges of the image. 


Some images didn't provide enough visual clues to do this, and I think the field of view didn't quite match it in all images (not sure though). ,Like: It is well implemented and easy to use. Zoom levels on the areas were well chosen, and the difficulties in determining the right angle in images became clear to me, at least, in some images. Very interesting.,Dislike: Holding shift was a bit uncomfortable, I wish the "rotation-mode" would be toggled on the whole time during this test because zooming and panning wasn't really necessary anyways.,Difficult: Some houses were continuous, but shown as two or more on the OSM map (the REWE images for example). For some images I had wished for a higher resolution image, like the starting image (Aasee Mensa image). Satellite imagery was sometimes helpful in distinguishing houses, I was trying to use the roof color and shape as a guide, but the overlay blocked that too much.,Like: Again, well implented. Very intuitive.,Dislike: -

56d0a9d19352a7914a102f6a,Paul Schaub,Difficult:It felt like I was mistaking left and right when pointing to the objects using the circle.

56d0d51c9352a7914a102f7f,mojio,Difficult:some techniqal problems with my left mouse click button made it difficult to hold it pressed :-\ ,Like: simple and intuitively understandable task. + for the places of muenster.,Dislike: pictures are taken in winter atmosphere. I dislike winter. 

For one of the images the camera was located Off-screen and I hat to first zoom out of to find the location. Intended or did my broken mouse issue that?,Difficult: more difficult for places I dont know. For those places, it was even more difficult, when the image was showing only small pieces of lots of buildings at once. This made it more difficult to select building on image and map correspondingly,Like: I saw my appartment in the first image :D,Dislike: in one or two pictures, too many fronts of similar-looking buildings side by side in a row. spended more time for those picture to figure out which building could be the corresponding one on the image

56d1f8ad9352a7914a102fd6,Stefan Fuest,Difficult:,Like: Very clear instructions,Dislike: Sometimes (when I was not sure about this location) it was possible for me to define the camera facing direction just by making the connection between the arrangement of buildings on the photo and the footprints and streets on the map. ,Difficult: ,Like: It was quite easy to solve and the setup of the task was well explained.,Dislike: Similarly to the previous task, I was for example able to connect the 'REWE' on the picture with a building visualized on the map, as there was a label or icon for it on the map.
56d2013c9352a7914a102feb,Carina Weber,Difficult:i think the camera position sometimes was inaccurate (on the picture you could see a street, but the camera was obviously placed on the other side of the street),Like: ,Dislike: ,Difficult: ,Like: ,Dislike: some buildings were very easily to find because of the captions on the map

Dies hätte überall um den See herum sein können.,Like: ich bin erstaunt, dass ich nur durch ein Bild die Kamera recht genau justieren konnte. (hoffe ich :-) ) ,Dislike: -,Difficult: Im InternetExplorer konnte ich nicht auf den Sateliten-Modus schalten. Dies wäre hilfreich gewesen, um gerade bei den Aaseebildern die Farbe der Gebäude mit zu berücksichtigen. ,Like: Es hat Spaß gemacht, dass obwohl einem das Bild nichts gesagt hat, man sich dennoch auf der Karte zurecht gefunden hat.,Dislike: Das der Satelitenmodus nicht geklappt hat.... Übrigens auch schon beim ersten Task nicht.
56df4366f52b965614cdc8b2,Wizard Garrick,Difficult:The test  does not work on ipad. It was not possible to use or move the camera so the second part of the test could not be completed properly,Like: Nice test,Dislike: ,,,

That´s why I didn´t move the camera as I was about to skip it.,Difficult: ,Like: ,Dislike:
